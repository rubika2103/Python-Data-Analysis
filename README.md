# Python Data Analysis & EDA Project

This project demonstrates data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and insight extraction using Python. The analysis was performed using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn inside a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Data Cleaning Performed
- Removed duplicates  
- Handled missing values  
- Converted numerical text columns  
- Removed invalid or inconsistent entries  
- Standardized column names  
- Derived additional features (if used)  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis explores how different attributes impact **cup score** and overall coffee quality.

### Key EDA steps:
- Summary statistics for all features  
- Distribution of coffee quality scores  
- Country-wise coffee quality comparison  
- Processing method analysis  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Flavor vs Aroma vs Sweetness comparison  
- Scatter plots for quality attributes  

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- Score distribution histogram  
- Boxplots for quality metrics  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Pairplots of key attributes  
- Bar charts for categories like:
  - Processing type  
  - Country of origin  
  - Species (Arabica vs Robusta)  

---

## Key Insights
- Aroma, flavor, and aftertaste show strong correlation with final cup score.  
- Arabica beans generally score higher than Robusta.  
- Natural and washed processing methods tend to deliver better quality scores.  
- Coffee from certain regions consistently achieved higher flavor and acidity ratings.  
- Defects and moisture level significantly affect coffee grade.

## Conclusion
This Coffee Quality project demonstrates:
✔ Strong data cleaning techniques  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔ Meaningful visualizations  
✔ Insight extraction from real-world data  
✔ Understanding of factors influencing coffee cup quality
